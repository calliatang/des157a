        /* Instructions: Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

        - The "for" statement sets the value of i at 1, and will continue to count upwards by 1 (i++) until it reaches 100 (i<101).
        - The "else" statement at the end makes the console print the value of i
        - The first "if" statement makes the console print "Fizz" if any of the below numbers result from a division of i by 3.
        - Otherwise (else if), the console will print "Buzz" if any of the below values result from a division of i by 5.
        - Otherwise, (else), print i as it would normally appear when counting from 1 to 100.

        - Numbers in the "if" and "else if" statements are all the numbers that 3 and 5 and multiply by without going above 100.

        I know there's probably a more efficient way to do this, but I can't figure it out. */
