        <h2>Thoughts on Overlays</h2>
        <time datetime="2023-10-18">October 18, 2023</time>

        <p>Just read the Medium article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a>. It brought up a lot of points on pop-ups that I agree with, like how annoying pop-ups can be on mobile, or how difficult they can be for users that use screen magnifiers. But despite their annoyances, they feel so clean and sophisticated compared to going through the effort to open a whole new page. But it also raises the question of whether pop-ups/overlays/etc are really needed, especially if the user is going to close them anyway. If anything, I guess modals are best used when the user intends for them to pop-up, like when a modal prompting you to login appears after you click, well, "log in".</p>

        <h2>Thoughts on Form Design</h2>
        <time datetime="2023-10-16">October 16, 2023</time>

        <p>Recently, I had the opportunity to read the article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a> on Medium. I thought the article brought up a lot of valid points when it comes to good form design. Forms are never fun to fill out, and I never noticed how much I disliked having to constantly with options that should really be one-click only. The article also brings up a lot of new ideas for me, such as the absence of negative messages (avoiding "you" statements that blame the user), or getting rid of the reset button to avoid confusing (and frustrating) users.</p>

        <p>On that note, a website form that I think exemplifies the best practices described in the article would be the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/personal-info">account creation form</a> for the FAFSA site. It does a good job of dividing the creation process into digestible chunks, and includes help buttons on what the user should fill out the form with. The actual FAFSA aid application also does something similar.</p>
