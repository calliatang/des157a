            <p>Project Summary: I am updating my "Every Picture" project, and plan on improving its visual design and functionality.</p>

            <p>Description: Visual design-wise, I want to improve the aesthetics of the site (this may overlap with UI/UX) by adding more graphics, changing the layout to be more animated/less structured and simple working. I plan to add more interactivity by making each image have multiple clickable overlays so that the user can explore the images more thoroughly. When the user hovers over one of the clickable hotspots that open the overlay, I want the image to change so that the hotspot is outlined/noticeable. I also want to include a minigame involving one of the overlays in one of the images.</p>

            <p>Feedback: I will get feedback from an undergrad design tutor for visual design, and I will do a code review with a graduate student TA.</p>
